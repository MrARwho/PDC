## Chapter 1: Getting Started with Parallel Computing

This chapter introduces parallel programming concepts and Python's role in enabling concurrency. Topics include:
- Differences between parallelism and concurrency.
- Understanding Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
- Introduction to threading and multiprocessing modules.

---

## Chapter 2: Multithreading Basics

Learn how to leverage Python's `threading` module to implement multithreading for I/O-bound tasks:
- Creating and starting threads.
- Thread synchronization using locks and semaphores.
- Practical use cases for multithreading.

---

## Chapter 3: Process Management

This chapter covers process-based parallelism with the `multiprocessing` module. Key topics include:
- Creating processes and managing them.
- Sharing data between processes with `Value` and `Array`.
- Using `Pool` for efficient process management.

---

## Chapter 4: Inter-Process Communication

Communication between processes is essential in parallel programming. Learn to:
- Use `Queue` and `Pipe` for message passing.
- Implement producer-consumer patterns.
- Handle large data exchanges safely.

---

## Chapter 5: Advanced Synchronization

Master advanced synchronization techniques for managing complex parallel tasks:
- Use of `Event`, `Barrier`, and `Semaphore`.
- Coordinating multiple processes efficiently.
- Handling race conditions and deadlocks.
